9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?
Setting Up and Starting Debugging
Install Required Extensions (if needed):
Some programming languages or frameworks may require specific debuggers. Install the necessary extensions from the VS Code Marketplace if prompted.

Open Your Project:
Open VS Code and navigate to the folder containing your project files using the File > Open Folder menu.

Create a Launch Configuration:
VS Code uses launch configurations to determine how to start your program for debugging. You can create a launch configuration manually or use predefined configurations for common setups.
Click on the Debugging icon in the Activity Bar (looks like a bug with a play button), then click on the gear icon to configure a launch.json file.

Set Breakpoints:
In your source code, click in the gutter next to the line number where you want to set a breakpoint. Breakpoints pause program execution at specific points to inspect variables and execution flow.

Start Debugging:
Press F5 or click the green play button next to the configurations dropdown to start debugging.
VS Code launches your program in debug mode and stops at the first breakpoint encountered.

Debugging Controls:
Once debugging starts, you can use the following controls from the Debug toolbar:
Step Over (F10): Execute the current line and move to the next line.
Step Into (F11): Move to the next line, stepping into function calls.
Step Out (Shift+F11): Finish executing the current function and return to the calling function.
Continue (F5): Resume execution until the next breakpoint or program completion.

Key Debugging Features in VS Code
Variable Inspection:
View the current value of variables and expressions in the Debug Console or hover over them in the editor during debugging.

Watch Expressions:
Add expressions to the Watch panel to monitor their values as you step through your code.

Call Stack:
View the function call hierarchy with the Call Stack panel, showing the path that led to the current execution point.

Conditional Breakpoints:
Set breakpoints that only trigger when specific conditions are met, enhancing flexibility in debugging.

Debug Console:
Interact with your program by entering commands and expressions directly into the Debug Console during debugging sessions.

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
Integrating Git with Visual Studio Code (VS Code) allows developers to manage version control directly within their coding environment. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to initialize a repository, make commits, and push changes to GitHub using VS Code:

Integrating Git with VS Code
Install Git:
Ensure Git is installed on your system. You can download it from git-scm.com and follow the installation instructions.

Open Your Project in VS Code:
Open VS Code and navigate to the folder containing your project files using File > Open Folder.

Initialize a Git Repository:
Open the Source Control view by clicking on the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar (or use the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+G).
Click on the Initialize Repository button or use the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P and type Git: Initialize Repository) to initialize a Git repository in your project folder.

Stage and Commit Changes:
Make changes to your files in VS Code.
In the Source Control view, you will see a list of changed files. Click on the + button next to a file to stage it for commit, or use the ... button to stage all changes.
Enter a commit message in the text box at the top of the Source Control view and press Ctrl+Enter or Cmd+Enter to commit the changes.

Push Changes to GitHub:
If your project is hosted on GitHub, you can push your changes directly to the remote repository.
Click on the sync button (... with arrows) in the Source Control view to open the Push/Pull view.
Click Push to push your committed changes to GitHub. If prompted, authenticate with your GitHub credentials.

Viewing Git History and Diffs:
You can view the commit history and changes (diffs) for each commit by clicking on the ... button next to a commit in the Source Control view.

Some other additional Git Operations
Branching: Create and switch between branches using the Source Control view or the integrated terminal.
